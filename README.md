Travelling Salesman Problem Solution using Genetic Algorithm

Welcome to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver implemented using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) in Python. This repository contains a complete solution to the TSP, leveraging the power of genetic algorithms to find an optimized route.
Introduction

The Travelling Salesman Problem is a classic algorithmic problem in the fields of computer science and operations research. The task is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city. This project uses a Genetic Algorithm to approximate the optimal solution.
Features

   Implementation of Genetic Algorithm to solve TSP.
   Visualization of the shortest route found.
   Configurable parameters for the genetic algorithm.
   Easy to use and modify for different datasets.
Example
You can try this algorithm using n number of ciites, along with their geographical coordinates.
In provided example, cities.csv contains 7 cities in Azerbaijan and their latitude and longitude.
The shortest path is illustrated like this:
